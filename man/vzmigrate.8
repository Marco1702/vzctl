.SH NAME
vzmigrate - utility for virtual environment migration between hardware nodes.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBvzmigrate\fR [\fB-r\fR|\fB--remove-area\fR \fByes\fR|\fBno\fR] [\fB--ssh=\fIssh_options\fR] \
[\fB--keep-dst\fR] [\fB--online\fR] [\fB-v\fR] \fIdestination_address\fR \fIVPSID\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility is used to migrate a VPS from one (source) Hardware
Node (HN) to another (destination) HN. The utility can migrate either stopped or running
VPS. For stopped VPS, simple VPS private area transfer is performed
(\fBrsync\fR(1) is used for file transfer). For running VPSs 
migration may be offline (default) or online.

This program uses ssh as a transport layer. You will need to put ssh
public key to destination node and be able to connect to node without
entering password.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB--remove-area\fR \fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
Whether to remove VPS on source HN for successfully migrated VPS.

.TP
\fB--ssh=\fIoptions\fR
Additional \fIoptions\fR that will be passed to ssh while establishing
connection to destination HN. You may add options like \fB-c blowfish\rR
or the like.

.TP
.B --keep-dst
Do not clean synced destination VPS private area in case of some
error. It makes sense to use this option on big VPS migration to avoid
syncing VPS private area again in case some error (on VPS stop for
example) occurs during first migration attempt.
 
.TP
.B --online
Perform online (zero-downtime) migration: during the migration the VPS
hangs for a while and after the migration it continues working as though nothing has
happened.

.TP
.B -v
Verbose mode. Causes \fBvzmigrate\fP to print debugging messages about its progress.
