.SH NAME
vzcalc \- utility to calculate the VE resources usage.
.SH SYNOPSIS
vzcalc [\fB-v\fR] <\fBvpsid\fR>
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-v\fR 4
Display additional information.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility displays the share of the Hardware Node resources a particular
Virtual Environment is using. If the VE is running, the current usage is
displayed. High utilization values (>100%) mean the system is overloaded
(or the VE has an invalid configuration).
.IP \fBCurrent\fR 4
shows the amount of the resources consumed by the VE at a given time.
.IP \fBPromised\fR 4
shows the resourses soft limit values "promised" for a given VE.
.IP \fBMax\ \fR 4 
shows the resourses hard limit values "promised" for a given VE.
.P
If the \fB-v\fR option is specified, the additional information is displayed.
.IP \fBLow\ Mem\fR 4
the part of memory residing at lower addresses and directly accessed by the kernel.
.IP \fBTotal\ Ram\fR 4
whole RAM
.IP \fBMem+Swap\fR 4
amount of memory available for applications (both RAM and swap space).
.IP \fBAlloc\ Mem\fR 4
standard memory allocations made for applications in a VE. This is a more "virtual" system resource than RAM or RAM and swap.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Normally, the exit status is 0. On error, the exit status is 1.
